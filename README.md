# Abstract

The National Science Foundation defines "cyberinfrastructure" (or "sociotechnical infrastructure") as "the hardware, software, networks, data and people that underpin today's advanced computing technology", particularly technologies that advance scientific discovery. In mathematics research, even theoretical mathematics, we use many technologies, and engage with many different communities, but there is little scholarship on the ad hoc research infrastructure itself that we implicitly rely on from day to day.

## A particular type of glue: math research infrastructure

- Conferences/workshops/seminars
- Journals (websites, submission management)
- Forums (MathOverflow, nLab)
- Software (SageMath, R, Python)
- Databases (LMFDB, OEIS, $\pi$-Base)
- Formalized math (Lean, Coq)
- Documents (LaTeX, Markdown, PreTeXt)

## Last December: AIM Workshop on Cyberinfrastructure

![w:800px center](image-4.png)

Participants came from several different backgrounds: established mathematicians, young researchers, educators, industry software developers. [[link](https://aimath.org/pastworkshops/cyberinfrastructure.html)]

## Working groups

- Formal Math Interoperability with CAS
- Databases of Visualizations
- Database of Databases
- Canonical Concepts and Alignment
- Knowledge Tracing
- Developer On-Ramps
- Community Values
- Math in the Future

## My cyberinfrastructure work

Before tenure: hobby

Post tenure: *scholarship* âœ¨âœ¨ (in my heart at least)

Two in particular:

- $\pi$-Base
- ScholarLattice
