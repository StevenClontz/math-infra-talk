# Abstract

The National Science Foundation defines "cyberinfrastructure" (or "sociotechnical infrastructure") as "the hardware, software, networks, data and people that underpin today's advanced computing technology", particularly technologies that advance scientific discovery. In mathematics research, even theoretical mathematics, we use many technologies, and engage with many different communities, but there is little scholarship on the ad hoc research infrastructure itself that we implicitly rely on from day to day.

## Papers = Research / Infrastructure = Service

- In mathematics, our currency as researchers is  measured in the papers we publish.

- But papers wouldn't exist (or serve the community) without
